Hi! I'm Claire Halloran ([they/them](https://www.mypronouns.org/they-them)), a doctoral candidate in energy systems engineering at the University of Oxford [Energy and Power Group](https://epg.eng.ox.ac.uk/). and Rhodes Scholar. I research the impact of heat pump deployment on the electricity system in the UK and US, with a focus on the spatial and grid planning aspects of this problem. During my PhD, I've become a bit of a map nerd and enjoyed communicating with policymakers and general audiences about my research. Before starting my PhD, I earned my Bachelor's in Materials Science and Engineering at MIT.
