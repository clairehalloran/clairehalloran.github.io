Hi! I'm Claire Halloran ([they/them](https://www.mypronouns.org/they-them)), a geospatially-focused energy system modeler specialized in sector-coupling applications and electricity demand changes. I am currently a researcher on the capacity expansion team in the Grid Planning and Analysis Center at the National Renewable Energy Lab. As a doctoral candidate in energy systems engineering at the University of Oxford  [Energy and Power Group](https://epg.eng.ox.ac.uk/) funded by the Rhodes Scholarship, I incorporated spatially granular heating data into electricity system planning models to assess the impact that residential heat pump deployment will have on the electricity system. As a part-time research assistant in the Climate Compatible Growth program, I developed an open-source geospatial planning tool to optimize green hydrogen production and transport. I'm also a bit of a map nerd and enjoy communicating with policymakers and general audiences about my research. Before starting my PhD, I earned my Bachelor's in Materials Science and Engineering at MIT.
